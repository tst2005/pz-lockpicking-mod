## Breaking Locks

If you want to break door and window locks you need to have a __crowbar__ in your inventory. Right click the door you want to open and it should give you the option to break the lock.

Be careful though, since this is rather noisy and will certainly attract some unwanted guests.

When you break open a door like that, there is a chance that the crowbar will slip and smash against the door, creating an even louder noise in the process. When you try opening a window with the crowbar there is a chance that the window will be smashed.

## Lockpicking

The art of silently opening a lock with a __screwdriver__ and a __bobby pin__ (the latter can be found or crafted from a paper clip). Unlike breaking a lock, using a lockpick is totally silent.

Although it has its dangers too. If you fail to open the lock, it can break, making any further lock picking attempts impossible. Even if you succeed with opening a door you might lose the bobby pin.

As you can see, both methods have their pros and cons and it is up to you to decide which one you prefer.

## Translations
The mod has already been translated to a bunch of different languages. If you want to add a translation, feel free to fork this project and send a pull request.
